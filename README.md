# Toronto-Fitness-Club-Web

## Procedures before running the server:
- run command `sh ./startup.sh` to create virtual environment and install required packages and initialize the database
- In order to ensure a successful startup, please run command `source ./venv/bin/activate` and change folder using `cd fitness_club` to go to the correct folder (make sure now you’re at **Toronto-Fitness-Club-Web/fitness_club** directory)
- create superuser manually and provide username, password, and email for the user (what we usually use is “admin, 123, a@b.cd”)
- run command `sh ../run.sh` to start the server (beware of the two dots)
